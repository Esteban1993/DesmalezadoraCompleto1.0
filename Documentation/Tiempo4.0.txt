Module "IntTiempo" (component TimerInt)
   - IntTiempo_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the timer. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - IntTiempo_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the timer. No events will be generated.
   - IntTiempo_EnableEvent -This method enables the events.
   - IntTiempo_DisableEvent -This method disables the events.

Module "BitLed_Verde" (component BitIO)
   - BitLed_Verde_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property 
                for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - BitLed_Verde_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - BitLed_Verde_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - BitLed_Verde_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - BitLed_Verde_NegVal -Negates (inverts) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(!GetVal())]. This method is

                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU0_SetEventMask -Enables/disables event(s). The events contained within the mask are enabled. Events not contained within
